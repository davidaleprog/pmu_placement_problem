PMU placement problem refers to placing a minimum amount of measurement units (Phasor Measurement Units) on an alactrical network sush that the whole network is obsrvable. Meaning we can know every values of voltage an current.

In this work we focuse on a version of this problem where each PMU can measure only voltage on the node it is placed on and current of one of the incident line. This is called Power Edge Set problem.

We investigate wether we can improve computation time for optimal placement with a resilience of 1 line. This mean observability constraint has to be satified if any single line breaks.
